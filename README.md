Various Eve Python based Projects

In this document I am uploading all my base coding projects for Eve Online as a third-party developer all scripted in Python.

I was running similar items in Excel but the time that it took was quite significant. I was looking for ways to speed it up and keep it simple and learn all at the same time.

This lead to buying a server, learning about Virtual systems (bare metal ESXI), SQL Servers (little), flat file structures, pandas and a whole slew of other things. 

Questions? Comments? Feel free to reach out to me and I'll respond A.S.A.P.!
